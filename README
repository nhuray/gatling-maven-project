This project is a template to run gatling load tests from Maven with the Maven Gatling Plugin.

You can run the sample simulations with :

> mvn gatling:execute

To run a set of simulations you have to use this command :

> mvn gatling:execute -Dgatling.simulations=basic.BasicExampleSimulation,advanced.AdvancedExampleSimulation


Have fun :-)
